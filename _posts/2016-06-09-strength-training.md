Strength training is a practice that applies a stress to one's body in
order to create a physical adaptation. This adaptation usually results
in the form of increased strength and or increased muscle mass.

I started strength training on March 2, 2015. As of today, I have
completed 181 workouts using the [Stronglifts 5x5 program][stronglifts].

Through this type of training I have learned to face new challenges and adapt to
setbacks. I have learned to push myself through perceived limits and
learned to take the necessary rest in order to progress.

Getting started is the hardest part. I found the following material to
be extremely useful:

1. [Starting Strength By Mark Rippetoe][starting-strength]
2. [StrongLifts 5x5][stronglifts]
3. [IronMind][ironmind]

The main lifts found in most strength training programs are the
Squat, the Overhead Press (aka the Press), the Deadlift, and the Bench
Press. These are considered compound exercises because each lift works
multiple muscle groups simultaneously. This is in contrast to
other exercise that isolate a single muscle group .e.g. bicep curls.

## Physical Strength

The goal of strength training is to gain more strength. The best way I
have found to achieve this is with a low number of sets and a low number of reps per set 
and a technique known as [progressive overload][progressive-overload]. 
The [Stronglifts][stronglifts] program recommends 5 sets of 5 reps. [Starting
Strength][starting-strength] recommends 5 sets of 3 reps.

Each workout you gradually increase the amount of weight that you put on
to the bar. It's best to begin with a very low weight and focus
intensely on technique. This will matter greatly as the weight starts to
get heavier.

Failure is a part of gaining strength. It's a good thing. It means you
have reached a physical limit or boundary that now needs remediation.
Food and sleep are vital to recovery. Over time, with the proper
adjustments, your body can and will adapt. Learning how to fail safely is
important in order to progress. 
[Starting Strength][starting-strength] 
will teach you proper technique and how to fail safely. 
I am on my third copy of this book and still re-reading chapters.

## Mental Strength

There is a mental aspect to strength training that I did not anticipate
when I first started. I have learned over time that if I have a sense or
feeling that I may fail at a certain weight. There is a good chance that
I will fail. The body seems to follow the mind. Learning to hack your mind to
prepare yourself for success is an important lesson. Your outlook on
your situation can affect the outcome. [IronMind][ironmind]
is filled with numerous short articles that explains how to overcome 
mental adversity and break through barriers.

## Honesty

Very few moments can be more humbling than failing at a squat attempt.
When done properly, there is little chance of injury. Failing in a crowded gym
can be a good dose of humility. Learning to fail publicly with dignity
is a valuable lesson. Learning to challenge yourself publicly beyond
your limits can also be exhilarating when you hit a personal record
(PR). 

## Partnership

It can be difficult to progress without help. Having a partner to help spot
you on a difficult bench press, or provide the proper
[cues](http://startingstrength.com/training/cues) at just the right
moment is essential.  A partner adds a level of accountability that
makes it difficult to deny. Form checks, knowledge sharing, motivation,
accountabilty, and kinship are all benefits of having a good partner.

*Strength training helps one to develop a strong mind, strong body and strong will.*
